## Visualization & Analysis
### Profitability Analysis (2019–2022)

### Revenue
McDonald’s revenue remained strong and relatively stable over the five-year period. After a dip to $19.208 billion in 2020 due to the pandemic, revenue rebounded to $23.223 billion in 2021. In 2022, it slightly declined by 0.17% to $23.183 billion, maintaining the company’s solid post-pandemic recovery trajectory.
### Profit
McDonald’s profit followed a similar trend to its revenue, declining in 2020 due to pandemic-related impacts, then rebounding strongly by 20.94% in 2021. In 2022, profit remained relatively stable with a negative 0.17%, reflecting the company’s ability to maintain profitability amid rising costs.
### Expenses
Total expenses in 2022 rose to $15.36 billion, an 8.94% increase from the prior year. This uptick likely stems from expanded operations, higher marketing spend, and inflation-driven cost pressures. However, unlike previous years, operating margin declined sharply by 14.12%, indicating that the rise in expenses outpaced revenue growth, putting pressure on overall profitability.
### Operating Margin (%)
In 2022, McDonald’s operating margin stood at $33.76 billion, reflecting a 14.12% decline from $39.31 billion in 2021. This drop reverses the strong 22.96% growth seen in 2021 and signals that rising expenses began to weigh more heavily on profitability. While margins had rebounded post-2020, the 2022 decline highlights growing operational cost pressures and the need for tighter expense management.
### Net Assets
McDonald’s reported negative net assets throughout the period, reflecting a capital structure heavily weighted toward liabilities. Net assets were -$8.22 billion in 2019, and slightly improved by 4.74% to -$7.83 billion in 2020. The trend continued in 2021, reaching -$4.61 billion, a significant 41.11% improvement from the prior year. However, in 2022, net assets dipped again by -30.37% to -$6.01 billion. This pattern suggests ongoing strategic use of debt financing, though persistent negative equity may raise long-term solvency concerns.
### Liabilities
McDonald’s total liabilities demonstrated some fluctuation but generally remained high, reflecting the company’s significant leverage. Total liabilities were $55.72 billion in 2019, rose to $60.45 billion in 2020, then declined to $58.20 billion in 2021, and further decreased to $56.43 billion in 2022. Persistent negative equity could signal potential long-term solvency risks if liabilities continue to outweigh assets.

### Valuation Analysis (2019–2022)

### Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The P/E ratio showed moderate fluctuations over the four-year period. It was 34.80B in 2019, dipped slightly to 33.80B in 2020, then declined further to 26.50B in 2021. In 2022, it rebounded to 31.30B, reflecting renewed investor confidence but still below 2019–2020 levels. The trend suggests a relatively stable valuation with some sensitivity to earnings or market sentiment.

### Debt to Equity (D/E) Ratio
The Debt to Equity Ratio remained negative throughout 2019 to 2022, indicating that the company’s total equity was negative in all four years. The ratio was -6.78 in 2019, worsened to -7.72 in 2020, and dropped further to -12.62 in 2021, reflecting increasing financial risk and higher debt relative to equity. However, in 2022, it improved slightly to -9.39, suggesting some progress in reducing leverage or recovering equity. Despite this improvement, the continued negative ratios highlight a persistently weak capital structure that may concern long-term investors.

### Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio
The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2022, reflecting consistent investor valuation relative to revenue. It started at 6.93 in 2019, increased to 8.32 in 2020, peaked slightly at 8.63 in 2021, and then edged down to 8.33 in 2022. The small variations suggest that while market valuation grew modestly, it stayed aligned with revenue trends, indicating steady investor sentiment and pricing discipline over the four-year period.

### Debt-to-Asset (D/E) Ratio
The Debt-to-Asset ratio stayed above 1.0 throughout 2019 to 2022, indicating that the company consistently carried more liabilities than assets, a sign of high financial leverage. It was 1.17 in 2019, decreased slightly to 1.15 in 2020, and then to 1.09 in 2021, before rising marginally to 1.12 in 2022. Despite the slight rebound, the overall trend reflects a gradual improvement, though the ratio still suggests that liabilities exceed total assets, raising concerns about solvency and long-term financial sustainability.

### Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio was consistently negative from 2019 to 2022, reflecting negative book value, likely due to accumulated losses or liabilities exceeding assets. It was -18.00 in 2019, declined further to -20.40 in 2020, and worsened to -43.50 in 2021. In 2022, the ratio improved to -32.20, indicating a slight recovery but still a significantly distressed equity position. The persistently negative P/B ratios suggest ongoing balance sheet challenges, though the 2022 improvement may hint at stabilization.

### Market capitalization
Market capitalization showed a steady upward trend from $147.47B in 2019 to $200.31B in 2021, reflecting growing investor confidence and value appreciation. However, in 2022, it slightly declined to $193.01B. Despite the dip, the overall four-year trend remains positive, with market cap increasing by over 30% since 2019, indicating sustained investor interest and growth in company valuation over time.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
From 2018 to 2022, McDonald’s demonstrated operational strength, rebounding from the pandemic with solid revenue and profit. However, rising costs in 2022 strained margins, and the company’s capital structure remains heavily leveraged. While market valuation remains strong, long-term sustainability will depend on cost control and balance sheet improvement.

## Key Recommendations:
### Improve Cost Efficiency
The significant rise in expenses in 2022 eroded operating margins. McDonald’s should conduct a thorough cost efficiency review, especially in areas like supply chain, energy usage, and labor, to restore margin strength without sacrificing customer experience.

### Reduce Financial Leverage
Continued negative equity and high debt levels pose long-term solvency risks. The company should explore gradual deleveraging through refinancing, selective asset sales, reinvesting retained earnings, or reducing debt, to improve financial resilience and flexibility.

### Enhance Equity Position
Persistent negative book value could affect access to capital and investor sentiment over time. Addressing the negative book value will improve investor confidence and creditworthiness. This can be done through liability restructuring or sustained profitability.

### Leverage Brand Strength
McDonald’s strong brand recognition played a critical role in its rapid post-pandemic recovery.  To maintain revenue growth, the company should continue investing in digital ordering, delivery platforms, and customer loyalty programs that drive customer retention. 

### Monitor Market Sentiment Closely
With valuation metrics such as P/E and P/S showing relative stability, it’s essential to track shifts in investor sentiment, as it is vulnerable to shifts in economic conditions. Regular engagement with shareholders and transparent reporting can help maintain trust.

### Prepare for External Risks
Inflation and global disruptions have proven impactful. Scenario planning should be embedded in the company’s financial strategy to anticipate and adapt to potential shocks
